abstract = {The circular restricted three-body model is widely used for astrodynamical studies in systems where two major bodies are present. However, thismodel relies onmany simplifications, such as point-mass gravity and planar, circular orbits of the bodies, and limiting its accuracy. In an effort to achieve higher-fidelity results while maintaining the autonomous simplicity of the classic model, we employ zonal harmonic perturbations since they are symmetric about the z- axis, thus bearing no time-dependent terms. In this study, we focus on how these perturbations affect the dynamic environment near the secondary body in real systems. Concise, easily implementable equations for gravitational potential, particle motion, and modified Jacobi constant in the perturbed model are presented. These perturbations cause a change in the normalized mean motion, and two different formulations are addressed for assigning this new value. The shifting of collinear equilibrium points in many real systems due to J2 of each body is reported, and we study how families of common periodic orbits—Lyapunov, vertical, and southern halo—shift and distort when J2, J4,and J6 of the primary and J2 of the secondary body are accounted for in the Jupiter–Europa and Saturn–Enceladus systems. It is found that these families of periodic orbits change shape, position, and energy, which can lead to dramatically different dynamical behavior in some cases. The primary focus is on moons of the outer planets, many of which have very small odd zonal harmonic terms, or no measured value at all, so while the developed equations are meant for any and all zonal harmonic terms, only even terms are considered in the simulations. Early utilization of this refined CR3BP model in mission design will result in a more smooth transition to full ephemeris model.},
