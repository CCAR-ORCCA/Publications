                  development of an autonomous attitude and shape
                  registration framework used in conjunction with an
                  autonomous relative navigation filter, both tailored
                  for operations about small bodies such as asteroid
                  Itokawa. These methods rely on Flash-Lidar data as
                  their only measurement type. In particular, an
                  instance of the Iterative-Closest-Point to Plane
                  algorithm is used to simultaneously recover the
                  target's attitude and blend it with the facet/vertex
                  shape model being constructed in a feature-tracking-
                  less fashion. Results demonstrate the capability of
                  the joint framework to construct a shape model of
                  the small body on-the-fly that is then utilized by
                  the navigation filter during a closer orbit phase.
                  Itokawa's volume was captured within 0:2{\%} when
                  observed from a 3-km orbit. A follow-up relative-
                  navigation phase over a 1 km-radius terminator orbit
                  allowed the spacecraft position to be determined
                  within 5 meters while using the shape model
                  previously reconstructed. Future work will improve
                  the fidelity of the simulation and leverage the
                  benefit from alternative shape parametrizations to
                  increase the overall framework's performance and
                  robustness.},

                  and Observation (NEACO) mission proposes to explore
                  the fast-rotating asteroid (469219) 2016 HO3with a
                  SmallSat spacecraft and perform an early scientific
                  investigation to enable future, more in-depth
                  missions. The NEACO spacecraft is equipped with a
                  low-thrust, solar electric propulsion system to
                  reach its target within two years, making use of an
                  Earth gravity assist. Its instrument suite consists
                  of two optical cameras, a spectrometer, an
                  altimeter, and an explosive impactor assembly. Upon
                  arrival at HO3, NEACO uses pulsed plasma thrusters
                  to hover, first at a high altitude of 50 km to
                  perform lit surface mapping and shape modeling, and
                  later at a lower altitude of 10 km to refine these
                  models and perform surface spectroscopy. Following
                  the hovering phases, the spacecraft performs several
                  flybys with decreasing periapses in order to
                  estimate the asteroid's mass. Finally, NEACO uses an
                  additional flyby to release an explosive impactor
                  that craters the asteroid surface. After spending a
                  few weeks at a safe hovering distance, the
                  spacecraft returns and images the crater and freshly
                  exposed sub-surface material. This provides
                  information on the strength of the asteroid surface.
                  The science operations are completed within eight
                  months, with the total mission lasting less than
                  three years. The objectives met by the NEACO mission
                  satisfy all science goals for the student
                  competition of the 2017 AAS Astrodynamics Specialist
                  Conference.},

                  reserved. The shape of irregular small bodies like
                  comets or asteroids has traditionally been
                  parametrized as a collection of low-degree surface
                  elements, such as polyhedrons or connected
                  quadrilaterals. The reconstruction of such shapes by
                  means of observation data is customarily carried out
                  on the ground, due to the computer-intensive nature
                  of the reconstruction process. This paper proposes
                  the use of triangular Bezier patches to fit point
                  cloud data obtained from a Flash Lidar. Flash-Lidar
                  measurements are a highly accurate data type well
                  suited to autonomous space vehicles, especially in
                  the context of operations about small bodies. Shapes
                  comprised of Bezier triangles offer a powerful
                  alternative to polyhedral shapes due to their
                  ability to capture curvatures, producing shapes of
                  resolution similar to much higher-resolution
                  polyhedrons. A shape estimate of asteroid Itokawa
                  reconstructed by means of our Lidar/Bezier pipeline
                  was obtained along with a quantification of the
                  uncertainty in the reconstructed shape. This
                  confidence measure was found to be consistent with
                  the effective shape fitting residuals, although
                  underfitting errors may dominate in some areas.},

                  usable to determine the shape model of a target, but
                  the collected data is too dense to be used as state
                  model parameters. Algorithms autonomously
                  constructing an a-priori from the observations are
                  thus needed. To this end, a feature extractor
                  autonomously computing an a-priori facet-vertex
                  shape model from the observations is constructed. A
                  batch estimator is used to determine the model
                  parameters from the a-priori and the observations.
                  This framework has been successfully tested on
                  noise-free observations. Future work will consist in
                  making the algorithm more robust to noisy data and
                  complex topology.},

                  of point pairs between a source and a destination
                  point cloud, followed by the calculation of the
                  rigid transform minimizing a relative distance (such
                  as the Iterative Closest Point-to-Plane distance
                  criterion) between the set of point pairs. The work
                  described in this paper presents an alternative
                  parametrization of the rotational component of the
                  rigid transform using Modified Rodrigues Parameters.
                  The performance of this formulation is compared to
                  that of Euler angles-based algorithms over random
                  and structured point clouds with increasing levels
                  of isotropic Gaussian noise. Additionally, pair
                  matching errors were introduced to assert the
                  performance of both algorithms when dealing with
                  more realistic data. Monte-Carlo results along with
                  more realistic test cases show a better performance
                  for the new MRP formulation in terms of accuracy and
                  speed, with convergence achieved in average 30{\%}
                  faster than the baseline algorithm.},
