@article{Ahern2014,
abstract = {The Helicon Injected Inertial Plasma Electrostatic Rocket (HIIPER) is an electric propulsion method being studied for potential use on deep space probes. Recent work done on HIIPER has resulted in increased understanding of the physics involved: Experimental studies have shown that with the present experiment, the plasma beam is composed primarily of electrons. However, as a space propulsion device, HIIPER would need to expel energetic ions to produce high thrust. The computational studies that have been performed indicate that the extraction of ions may be possible using a device such as an extractor grid. These theories are currently being experimentally tested, along with other aspects of making HIIPER a forefront space propulsion method. It is anticipated that once ion flow can be achieved, HIIPER will be demonstrated to be a competitive space thruster design due to its simplicity, low-weight, and high velocity exhaust.},
