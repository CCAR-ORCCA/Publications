abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Univelt Inc. All rights reserved. This paper provides insight into the development of an autonomous attitude and shape registration framework used in conjunction with an autonomous relative navigation filter, both tailored for operations about small bodies such as asteroid Itokawa. These methods rely on Flash-Lidar data as their only measurement type. In particular, an instance of the Iterative-Closest-Point to Plane algorithm is used to simultaneously recover the target's attitude and blend it with the facet/vertex shape model being constructed in a feature-tracking-less fashion. Results demonstrate the capability of the joint framework to construct a shape model of the small body on-the-fly that is then utilized by the navigation filter during a closer orbit phase. Itokawa's volume was captured within 0:2{\%} when observed from a 3-km orbit. A follow-up relative-navigation phase over a 1 km-radius terminator orbit allowed the spacecraft position to be determined within 5 meters while using the shape model previously reconstructed. Future work will improve the fidelity of the simulation and leverage the benefit from alternative shape parametrizations to increase the overall framework's performance and robustness.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Univelt Inc. All rights reserved. The Near-Earth Asteroid Characterization and Observation (NEACO) mission proposes to explore the fast-rotating asteroid (469219) 2016 HO3with a SmallSat spacecraft and perform an early scientific investigation to enable future, more in-depth missions. The NEACO spacecraft is equipped with a low-thrust, solar electric propulsion system to reach its target within two years, making use of an Earth gravity assist. Its instrument suite consists of two optical cameras, a spectrometer, an altimeter, and an explosive impactor assembly. Upon arrival at HO3, NEACO uses pulsed plasma thrusters to hover, first at a high altitude of 50 km to perform lit surface mapping and shape modeling, and later at a lower altitude of 10 km to refine these models and perform surface spectroscopy. Following the hovering phases, the spacecraft performs several flybys with decreasing periapses in order to estimate the asteroid's mass. Finally, NEACO uses an additional flyby to release an explosive impactor that craters the asteroid surface. After spending a few weeks at a safe hovering distance, the spacecraft returns and images the crater and freshly exposed sub-surface material. This provides information on the strength of the asteroid surface. The science operations are completed within eight months, with the total mission lasting less than three years. The objectives met by the NEACO mission satisfy all science goals for the student competition of the 2017 AAS Astrodynamics Specialist Conference.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Univelt Inc. All rights reserved. The shape of irregular small bodies like comets or asteroids has traditionally been parametrized as a collection of low-degree surface elements, such as polyhedrons or connected quadrilaterals. The reconstruction of such shapes by means of observation data is customarily carried out on the ground, due to the computer-intensive nature of the reconstruction process. This paper proposes the use of triangular Bezier patches to fit point cloud data obtained from a Flash Lidar. Flash-Lidar measurements are a highly accurate data type well suited to autonomous space vehicles, especially in the context of operations about small bodies. Shapes comprised of Bezier triangles offer a powerful alternative to polyhedral shapes due to their ability to capture curvatures, producing shapes of resolution similar to much higher-resolution polyhedrons. A shape estimate of asteroid Itokawa reconstructed by means of our Lidar/Bezier pipeline was obtained along with a quantification of the uncertainty in the reconstructed shape. This confidence measure was found to be consistent with the effective shape fitting residuals, although underfitting errors may dominate in some areas.},

abstract = {Flash-Lidar sensors provide valuable observations usable to determine the shape model of a target, but the collected data is too dense to be used as state model parameters. Algorithms autonomously constructing an a-priori from the observations are thus needed. To this end, a feature extractor autonomously computing an a-priori facet-vertex shape model from the observations is constructed. A batch estimator is used to determine the model parameters from the a-priori and the observations. This framework has been successfully tested on noise-free observations. Future work will consist in making the algorithm more robust to noisy data and complex topology.},

abstract = {Point-cloud registration pertains to the computation of point pairs between a source and a destination point cloud, followed by the calculation of the rigid transform minimizing a relative distance (such as the Iterative Closest Point-to-Plane distance criterion) between the set of point pairs. The work described in this paper presents an alternative parametrization of the rotational component of the rigid transform using Modified Rodrigues Parameters. The performance of this formulation is compared to that of Euler angles-based algorithms over random and structured point clouds with increasing levels of isotropic Gaussian noise. Additionally, pair matching errors were introduced to assert the performance of both algorithms when dealing with more realistic data. Monte-Carlo results along with more realistic test cases show a better performance for the new MRP formulation in terms of accuracy and speed, with convergence achieved in average 30{\%} faster than the baseline algorithm.},
